## Election-Audit Summary: 

This analysis is an efficient tool that can be used in other elections to quickly determine the distribution of votes from a raw source election data.  This information is highly useful for monitoring the results and can be used for certification of the final results.

This script can be modified as follows:

-	The script can also be used for other local, state, and federal elections.
-	It can report on additional data elements such as political party or any other data that can be obtained in an input file.
-	Different analyses can also be done.  For example, an analysis of votes by candidate by geography can be created as well as any other similar reports
-	These reports can be standardized to run not only to certify the final result of an election but can also be run at will during the election event to monitor the race as the votes come in.
